'''
  Bug introduction is actually not a simple thing to do.
  There might be a few bug types that I would like to try out.

  Bugs that won't work:
    - changing of names: it will not work because my lexer 
      process completely discards names and changes them into
      dummy names like (R1, R2, NUM_LIT)

  Bugs that might be worth trying to implement:
    - change of condition in control statements
    -
